# cBioPortal Seed Database

These files are MySQL database dump files for seeding a new instance of the cBioPortal database. They contain all the necessary background data for a properly functioning cBioPortal website, including cancer types, genes, uniprot-mappings, drug and network data.

The database schema and cBioPortal release follows different numbering cycles since cBioPortal 1.5.0 and database schema 2.1.0. This means that the version numbers won't be identical. cBioPortal 1.9.0 with database schema 2.4.0 removed PDB annotations from the database.


## For developers
Updating the seed database for Datahub is described [here](Update-Seed-Database.md).
