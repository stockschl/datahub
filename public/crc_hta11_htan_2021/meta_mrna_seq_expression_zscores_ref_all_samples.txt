profile_name: Pesudo bulk mRNA expression z-scores
profile_description: Single cell RNA-seq raw counts were normalized by median library size, log-like transformed with Arcsinh, and Z-score standardized per gene. The bulk RNA-seq counts were calculated from scRNA-seq, by averaging the expression values per sample across the cells.
