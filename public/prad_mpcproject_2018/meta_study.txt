description: Whole-exome sequencing of 19 metastatic prostate cancer patients. The Metastatic Prostate Cancer Project is a patient-driven initiative. This study includes genomic data, patient-reported data (pre-pended as PRD), medical record data (MedR), and pathology report data (PATH).  As these data were generated in a research, not a clinical, laboratory, they are for research purposes only and cannot be used to inform clinical decision-making. All annotations have been de-identified. More information is available at www.mpcproject.org.
